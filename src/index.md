She writes irregular, sporadic, messy posts about content, the web, and things of occasional interest. You may find her on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/RellyAB). She's often on Slack but unless you work at [Zone Digital ](http://www.zonedigital.com) you won't see her posts. It's okay, they're mostly about her dog.
